# CGAP — SaaS Setup Copilot (YC-Style Pitch)

## One-Liner
- **CGAP** turns your use-case into **clickable, step-by-step setup** inside your SaaS — grounded in your docs, screenshots, and product walkthrough videos.

## Problem
- SaaS tools are powerful but hard to learn: users don’t want more docs, they want to **finish a workflow** (create a campaign, build a report, fix tracking).
- Teams write requirements/PRDs, then struggle to translate them into the right **dashboard clicks, settings, naming conventions, and validation steps**.
- Support & onboarding calls don’t scale; the same “how do I…?” questions repeat, and it’s hard to see where users are stuck.

## Solution
- An in-product copilot with two modes:
  - **Do mode**: “I want to do X” → steps + checklist + links/timestamps
  - **Explain mode**: “What is this screen/metric?” → plain-English explanation + where to go next
- Optional **Autopilot** for repeatable flows (safe browser automation scoped to your SaaS).
- Analytics that clusters “stuck moments” into actionable enablement gaps (docs, UI, templates).

## Why it wins
- Scoped to **one SaaS UI per customer** → far more reliable than generic “web agents”.
- Evidence-first: citations/timestamps, never guesses.
